Learning how to do things that I never did before is a stuggle itself.
Learning coding xml & java & understanding how the code works with each
other & how it makes the app work and function. That is the toughest struggle
with building an android app.
Learning how to build a residential house the correct way so that the house is
safe to live in, is a stuggle if you never did carpenter work.
