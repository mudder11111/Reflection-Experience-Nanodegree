My name is Hello richard lee gavitt and I intend to legally change my name in the future because I don't
like my name.
The struggle I have now is, I thought that this course is the basic nanodegree android course. So when I
started the lessons, and in the lessons, It says android basics resources, and the 1st lessons are repeats
of the basic android studio lessons. I was confused at first, so I will keep going and I figured it is
a refresher from phase 1 scholarship
Now I have just learned something new and I have to blast that information into my brain and learn the terminology.
Learning how to do things that I never did before is a stuggle itself.
Learning coding xml & java & understanding how the code works with each
other & how it makes the app work and function. That is the toughest struggle
with building an android app.
Learning how to build a residential house the correct way so that the house is
safe to live in, is a stuggle if you never did carpenter work.
